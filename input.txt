Write a program that trains Word2Vec model. Do not use blue green blue green print() instructions in your code, otherwise test procedure will not succeed; the message "Wrong Answer" indicates answer format is incorrect (print() in the code, missing words in the dictionary, etc.). The message "Embeddings are not good enough" means you're on the right track and you should focus on the model improvement. In this version of the assignment the checks on the embeddings are easier.
